Familiarize yourself with the pieces of the Sample App
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Sample App has been provided to help familiarize you with the OUYA ODK and is made up of the following files and directories:

 - AndroidManifest.xml: Essential information about the application to the Android system, information the system must have before it can run any of the application's code.  See http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html for further specifics.
 - build.gradle: Gradle build script
 - res: Android resources tree. http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/available-resources.html has more information.
 - src: Java source code for the in-app purchase sample application.
 - test: Java source code for the unit tests for the in-app purchase sample application.
 - tmp: This directory is empty. After you've run the tests, you'll see a .jar file in this directory. You should not need to change this.

----------------------------------------------------------
Make developer-specific changes to the Sample App
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Login to the Developer Portal at https://developer.ouya.tv and make a note of your developer UUID:
2. Navigate to Products and add two or more products.  For at least one of these products, the product identifiers should start with "__DECLINED__"
3. Find and edit the following file: src => java => tv => ouya => sample => IapSampleActivity.java
 - Change DEVELOPER_ID to match the UUID that you noted from the Developer Portal.
 - Remove the existing strings from PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER_LIST and update it with the list of product identifiers you created in step 2 of this section.  They must match the product identifiers you defined in the Developer Portal exactly.

-----------------------------------------
Compile and build the Sample App
-----------------------------------------

1. From a terminal window, navigate to the top-level directory of the sample code (where this README resides)
2. Run "android update project --path ."
3. Run "./gradlew clean build test" to compile the code and run the automated tests.

If you see any test failures, look at the appropriate test output file in the bin/out/reports/tests directory.

4. If the tests run successfully, run "ant debug" to create an APK.

----------------------------------
Installing The Sample APKs On Your Device
----------------------------------

You should now have the sample APK to install:

1) Run "adb install -r build/apk/iap-sample-app-debug-unaligned.apk" to install the sample app.

-----------------------
Use the Sample App
-----------------------

The Sample App should be visible under the name "IAP Sample App" in the Apps screen on your device.

 - Tap to start the app and sign in with your Developer Portal credentials.
 - The buttons at the top should correspond to the product identifiers you added to IapSampleActivity.java and on the server through the Developer Portal.
 - Tapping on each of the buttons will allow you to purchase one of the products and see the flow.
   - Some popups/dialogs you'll see are built into the IAP service, some are part of the Sample App.  The latter can be distinguished by a "IAP Sample APP" header.
   - When the user taps on one of the products, the Sample App turns processing over to the IAP service, which presents a confirmation dialog.
   - If the user confirms the purchase, a request is sent from the IAP service to the server, which returns a success/failure message.
   - This response is conveyed back to the Sample App by the IAP service.
   - Based on this response, the Sample App displays a purchase succeeded popup or a failed dialog.
   - The IAP service also provides a response back to the Sample App when the purchase is canceled.  The Sample App the displays a failed dialog in this case.
   - Note that when you attempt to purchase a product whose product identifier starts with "__DECLINED__", the server/service will always return a payment declined error.  These special product identifiers allow you to test for the failed case.
 - Tapping on the "Request Gamer UUID" button at the bottom will return an ID for the currently logged-in gamer.  This ID is unique to each gamer on a per-developer basis (meaning the server will return a different ID for each developer that requests it for the same gamer).
